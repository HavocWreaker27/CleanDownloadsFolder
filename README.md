# CleanDownloadsFolder
Python Script to Sort Files in Downloads Folder on Startup

To use this porgram and get it to run on startup on your windows machine, simply download the CleanDownlaods.py file in this repository and place it in your Startup directory. 

This startup directory can be accessed by hitting the Windows Key + R and then running the command "Shell:Startup"

11/2/2020 UPDATE: Updated code for python3 compatibility. Added "Videos" sorting commands and folder.
